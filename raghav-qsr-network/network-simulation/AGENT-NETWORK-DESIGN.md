# QSR Insight Discovery Network - Agent Design Philosophy

## 🎯 Core Design Principles

### Universal Agents (No Specialization by Content Type)

**We're building UNIVERSAL agents that adapt purely based on data** - no specialized "gap analysis" or "paradox hunter" agents, just universal research functions that let the DATA decide where to pivot (like RecurSearch's pattern).

**These universal agents use only two tools (exaAnswerTool + exaDeepResearchTool) with data-driven decision making** - if KFC data reveals boring insights, agents automatically pivot to investigate same-parent dynamics with Taco Bell, or abandon KFC entirely for Wingstop.

### The Beautiful Irony: Universal Function + Expert Identity

**While functionally universal, each agent has deep QSR industry expertise personas** (Wharton MBA analysts, PE advisors, McKinsey consultants) - so they're universal research agents specialized for restaurant industry intelligence.

This creates the perfect balance:
- **HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE:** Universal (can research ANY QSR company, ANY insight type)  
- **INDIVIDUAL AGENT IDENTITY:** QSR Expert Specialists with institutional credibility

### Quality Through Iron Sharpening Iron + Pre-Filtering

**Quality ensured through dual-layer approach:**
1. **Topic Pre-Filtering:** QSR Topic Picker Agent ensures only high-viral-potential research targets reach core network
2. **Institutional Evaluation:** QSR experts create insights for brutal evaluation by "Senior Restaurant Analyst" - iron sharpening iron until only McKinsey-grade insights pass through

**Result: Efficient resource allocation + institutional quality standards = systematic viral insight generation**

#### **LEVEL 0: Web Search Story Hunting & Viral Potential Assessment**
**Agent:** QSR Topic Picker Agent
**Process:**
- **Web Search Strategy:** Scan recent QSR industry news for strategic changes, surprises, counterintuitive moves
- **Story Signal Detection:** Look for keywords indicating viral potential:
  - "raises fees/prices but growth accelerates" (counterintuitive)
  - "same parent company different performance" (paradox)
  - "refuses to franchise/unusual strategy" (contrarian)
  - "surprising results/unexpected outcomes" (anomalies)
  - "strategic pivot/transformation" (change stories)
- **Viral Assessment Logic:** "Would this surprise a Wharton MBA restaurant analyst?"
- **Decision Framework:** 
  - ✅ HIGH POTENTIAL: Counterintuitive, surprising, insider information, strategic anomalies
  - ❌ LOW POTENTIAL: Obvious trends, expected outcomes, surface-level news
- **Output:** Pre-vetted research targets with story context ("Research Chipotle: refuses franchising despite industry norm")
- **Tool:** webSearch for QSR industry story hunting

**Web Search Query Examples:**
```
- "QSR franchise model changes 2024 strategy"

- **Tool:** deepResearchPromptAgent + exaDeepResearchTool

#### **LEVEL 5: Quality Validation & Final Approval**
**Agent:** Senior Restaurant Analyst (Brutal Evaluator)
**Process:**
- Institutional-grade evaluation using dual criteria
- **Emotional Intelligence:** Makes reader feel sophisticated/smart
- **Social Capital:** Reader would confidently share professionally  
- **Decision:** APPROVE (meets institutional standards) OR REJECT (return to Topic Picker for new research target)
- **No Iteration:** Clean approval/rejection prevents complex fallback loops

### Critical Decision Points (Data-Driven Pivoting)

1. **Topic Assessment:** "Does this company have viral story potential?" (Topic Picker Agent)
2. **Anomaly Assessment:** "Is this outlier significant enough for institutional interest?"
3. **Financial Validation:** "Do unit economics support the anomaly as strategic vs operational failure?"  
4. **Mathematical Potential:** "Can I create shocking quantified insights from this data?"
5. **Strategic Depth:** "Is there sufficient mechanism/reasoning for institutional analysis?"
6. **Quality Gate:** "Does this meet McKinsey/Wharton MBA standard for viral sharing?"

### Network Failure Handling & Fallback Strategies

#### **Scenario 1: Research Dead End (Level 1-3)**
```
Problem: Network researches company but data shows boring/obvious insights
Examples: 
- "KFC has standard industry margins, no anomalies"
- "Subway declining predictably, no surprising mechanisms"

Fallback Strategy: TOPIC ABANDONMENT
- Agent Decision: "This research path has no viral potential"
- Action: END current research, return to Topic Picker Agent  
- Next: Topic Picker selects different company with higher viral potential
- Cost Control: Maximum 25-30 API calls before abandoning unpromising research
```

#### **Scenario 2: Brutal Evaluation Failure (Level 5)**  
```
Problem: Network generates insight but fails brutal quality standards
Examples:
- "FAILS emotional intelligence test - this is obvious industry knowledge"
- "FAILS social capital test - would not share this surface-level analysis"

Fallback Strategy: TOPIC ABANDONMENT  
- Agent Decision: "This research direction cannot meet institutional standards"
- Action: END current research, return to Topic Picker Agent
- Next: Topic Picker selects completely different company/angle
- Iteration Limit: Maximum 1-2 brutal evaluation attempts per topic before abandoning
```

#### **Key Design Philosophy: Clean Abandonment**
- **No complex iteration loops or pivot strategies within same topic**
- **Topic Picker Agent pre-filters for viral potential (prevents most failures)**
- **If core network can't extract institutional insight → topic was wrong choice → move to next**
- **Efficient resource allocation:** Focus API calls on pre-vetted high-potential stories

### Three-Tool Integration Pattern with Web Search Pre-Filtering

**webSearch Usage (Level 0):**
- **QSR industry story hunting:** Scan recent news for strategic changes, surprises, counterintuitive moves
- **Story signal detection:** Keywords indicating viral potential (contrarian strategies, performance paradoxes, insider information)
- **Viral assessment:** "Would this surprise institutional investors?"
- **Output:** Pre-vetted research targets with story context
- **Cost:** Low - web search for broad story discovery

**exaAnswerTool Usage:**
- **Level 1:** Market survey queries (10-15) - financial, competitive, operational, or regulatory patterns  
- **Level 2:** Data forensics queries (15-25) - adapts to insight type (financial, competitive, operational, survival, franchise/regulatory)
- **Total:** 25-40 targeted data extraction queries 
- **Function:** Raw data collection for mathematical analysis on pre-vetted topics

**exaDeepResearchTool Usage:**
- **Level 4:** Single comprehensive strategic investigation (adapts to insight type)
- **Function:** Strategic WHY and mechanism discovery (financial rationale OR competitive dynamics OR operational advantages OR survival mechanics OR franchise engineering)
- **Integration:** Explains mathematical insights with strategic reasoning appropriate to analysis type (including regulatory context when needed)

### Efficient Resource Allocation Through Web Search Pre-Filtering
**Web Search Topic Picker prevents wasted expensive research:**
- **Story hunting** via web search identifies QSR companies doing interesting things RIGHT NOW
- **Viral signal detection** filters for counterintuitive strategies, paradoxes, insider information
- **Pre-filters boring companies/angles** before expensive Exa Answer/Deep Research begins
- **Only web-validated high-potential stories** reach costly core network analysis
- **Clean abandonment** when research/evaluation fails (no iteration loops)
- **Cost hierarchy:** Cheap web search → expensive targeted research → most expensive deep research

### Tool Cost Optimization Strategy:
- **Level 0:** Low-cost web search for broad story discovery (high volume, low cost)
- **Levels 1-2:** Targeted Exa Answer API for precise data extraction (medium cost, high value)
- **Level 4:** Comprehensive Exa Deep Research for strategic context (high cost, complete insight)
- **Result:** Maximum insight quality with optimal resource allocation
