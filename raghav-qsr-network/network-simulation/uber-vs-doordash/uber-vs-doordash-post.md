DoorDash tripled market share in 5 years. Uber Eats stayed flat.

DoorDash launched DashPass in 2018. $9.99/month. Unlimited delivery.

Uber launched Uber One in 2024. 6 years late.

6 years behind = fighting established habits. $9.99/month × 60 months = $600 lifetime value already captured.

Execution:

DoorDash: 95% on-time, 26-minute delivery, advanced routing, order batching.

Uber Eats: 30-minute delivery, drivers switching between rides/food/grocery, multi-vertical resource allocation.

DoorDash drivers deliver food. Uber drivers deliver everything. Focus dilutes.

Restaurant exclusivity:

DoorDash (2014-2020):
• Exclusive agreements with suburban restaurant chains
• Connected to restaurant ordering systems within one week
• Locked competitors out

Uber Eats:
• Urban restaurant focus
• No aggressive suburban exclusivity
• Leveraged ride-sharing relationships

Exclusive deals = locked out. Can't deliver from restaurants under contract.

Geographic sequencing:

Phase 1 (2014-2018): DoorDash dominated urban markets. SF, LA, NYC, Chicago. Beat Grubhub and Uber.

Phase 2 (2018-2020): Expanded to suburbs with exclusivity deals. Uber didn't follow aggressively.

Urban economics work better: shorter routes, higher density. But DoorDash won both. Uber only competed urban.

Strategic constraints:

Uber: $20B ride-sharing + $12.5B grocery + food delivery = three priorities competing for driver time.

DoorDash: Food delivery = only priority. All resources optimized for one business.

Pure-play beats diversified.

Q3 2024:
• DoorDash: $2.7B revenue, first profitable year, 24% growth
• Uber Eats: $3.5B revenue, 4.1% margin, 13% growth

More revenue ≠ more profit when your model splits resources across three businesses.

The compounding loop:

DashPass (2018) → customer lock-in → higher order frequency → better restaurant deals → exclusive agreements → suburban dominance → 95% on-time rate → more customers.

Uber's 2024 subscription launch fights this with same price, weaker metrics (30 min vs 26 min), no exclusive access.

2024: DoorDash 60.7%, Uber Eats 23%.
