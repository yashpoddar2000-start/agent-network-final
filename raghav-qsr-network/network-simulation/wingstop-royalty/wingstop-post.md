Wingstop made it more expensive to open a store and growth accelerated.

Franchise buy-in jumped $145K between 2019 and 2024. In that same period, they grew from 1,385 to 2,214 locations.

2019: The Starting Point
• Franchise cost: $390K
• SEC filing: "We target a franchisee return of approximately 35% to 40%"
• Average sales per location: $1.2M/year
• 1,313 locations

2020: Proof of Concept
• Average sales per location: $1.5M (delivery boom)
• 94% of new locations opened by existing franchisees
• Royalty revenue: $108.9M

2021-2023: The Price Climb
• Franchise cost rises: $400K → $480K
• SEC filing updates promise: "We target a franchisee return of approximately 50%+"
• Average sales per location: $1.8M by 2023
• 90%+ of expansion still from existing franchisees

2024: The Result
• Franchise cost: $535K (37% higher than 2019)
• Average sales per location: $2.1M (75% higher than 2019)
• 2,165 locations
• Royalty revenue: $259.6M (5.6x growth since 2015)

The counterintuitive part: raising the franchise fee didn't slow expansion because Wingstop simultaneously engineered the conditions that made each location more profitable. A higher upfront cost became acceptable when the annual returns grew even faster.

Here's how they increased sales per location without owning the stores:

• Marketing: Forced franchisees to contribute 5.3% of sales to an advertising fund (up from 4% in 2019). More ads = more customers.

• Digital ordering: Built the app and website. By 2020, 60% of orders were digital. Franchisees didn't build the tech but got the sales.

• Real estate: Shifted from urban dine-in to suburban drive-thru. Lower rent, higher takeout volume.

• Supply chain: With 2,000+ locations, Wingstop negotiated discounts with suppliers and collected rebates ($17.7M in 2023). Pure profit.

• Menu: Wings, fries, sides. Simple menu = lower labor costs = higher margins for franchisees.

Between 2019-2021, over 90% of new locations were opened by franchisees who already owned Wingstops. If the economics didn't work, they wouldn't expand.

Wingstop added 1,339 franchised locations from 2015-2024. They only added 31 company-owned stores. They let franchisees take the risk of opening stores while collecting guaranteed 6% royalties on every dollar sold.
