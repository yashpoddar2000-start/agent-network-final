Fast-casual bowl chains are all dealing with the same pressures right now. Consumer spending down, food costs up, labor expensive. Here's how different chains are handling it.

In Q2 2025, the cracks are showing. Chipotle's same-store sales dropped -4%. Cava fell to 2.1% growth, down from 21% earlier in the year. Sweetgreen declined -7.6%.

All three generate similar revenue per location:
• Cava: $2.9 million annually
• Sweetgreen: $2.8 million annually
• Chipotle: $3.2 million annually

Same volume. Different survival rates.

The difference shows up in operating efficiency.

Restaurant-level operating margins (Q2 2025):
• Chipotle: 27.4%
• Cava: 26.3%
• Sweetgreen: 18.9%

That 7.4-point margin gap between Cava and Sweetgreen on similar revenue is everything. Both are fast-casual chains selling $16-24 bowls to similar customer demographics. Both face the same cost pressures. But Cava extracts $74,000 more profit per million dollars of revenue.

At their respective volumes, that's roughly $215,000 more profit per Cava restaurant annually. Across 398 Cava locations versus 260 Sweetgreen locations, the difference compounds.

Where it shows up:

Occupancy costs as percentage of revenue (Q2 2025):
• Chipotle: ~5.0%
• Cava: 6.8%
• Sweetgreen: 8.9%

Occupancy includes rent, utilities, and related expenses. The 2.1-point gap between Cava and Sweetgreen reflects a combination of real-estate strategy (urban vs suburban mix, unit size, drive-thru capability) and operational leverage in extracting revenue from each square foot.

At $2.9 million annual revenue, a 2.1-point occupancy cost difference equals roughly $61,000 per location annually.

Labor costs (Q2 2025):
• Chipotle: 24.7%
• Cava: 25.0%
• Sweetgreen: 27.5%

Food, beverage & packaging costs (Q2 2025):
• Chipotle: 28.9%
• Cava: 29.4%
• Sweetgreen: 27%

These cost structure differences compound at scale. The 7.4-point margin gap translates to roughly $207,000 less profit per Sweetgreen location annually compared to Cava.

When same-store sales growth turns negative, these gaps matter. A 2% decline in traffic at Cava's margins is survivable. At Sweetgreen's margins, it's a crisis.

The chart shows everyone declining. But declining from 26.3% margins versus 18.9% margins determines who survives the next 12 months.
