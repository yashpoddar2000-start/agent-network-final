Chipotle refuses to franchise 3,500 restaurants. That decision is worth $1.2B per year.

McDonald's: 95% franchised
Subway: 100% franchised 
Chipotle: 0% franchised

Owning stores generates $1.9B in operating income. Franchising would generate $700M.

2024 unit economics:
• Store revenue: $3.2M
• Store investment: $1.0M
• Store profit: $862K/year
• Restaurant-level margin: 26.7%
• Payback: 3 years
• ROIC: 25%

Franchise alternative:
• Royalty: 8% × $3.2M = $256K/store
• Revenue: $904M (3,500 stores × $256K)
• Operating income: ~$700M (after franchise support costs)

2015:
• 2,010 restaurants
• Operating income: $764M

2024:
• 3,500 restaurants
• Operating income: $1.9B

Operating income grew 2.5x in 9 years. All company-owned.

If they'd franchised in 2015, they'd collect ~$700M in royalties today. Instead, they generate $1.9B.

Why? Control.

That efficiency requires centralized control:
• Uniform training protocols
• Choreographed crew movements 
• Integrated digital ordering systems
• Same-day fresh ingredient delivery (no freezers, no microwaves)

Franchisees won't maintain this discipline. Without execution consistency, ROIC collapses.

Chipotle partners with 100+ suppliers but maintains tight control through:
• Volume purchasing power (3,500 stores)
• Direct contracts (no third-party distributors)
• Quality standards (DNA testing, no antibiotics, no hormones)

Result: Food costs at 29.8% vs competitors at 32-35%.

That 2-3% margin advantage = $226M+ annual savings on $11.3B revenue.

Franchising fragments purchasing. Volume discounts disappear. Margins compress.

The math:

Current model (company-owned):
• 3,500 stores × $862K profit = $3.0B store-level profit
• Corporate overhead (G&A): $697M
• Operating income: $1.9B
• Operating margin: 17%

Franchise model (hypothetical):
• 3,500 stores × 8% royalty = $904M revenue
• Corporate overhead: ~$200M
• Operating income: ~$700M
• Operating margin: 77%

On paper, franchising delivers higher margins (77% vs 17%).

But total operating income drops from $1.9B to $700M.

That's $1.2B lost per year.

Why not take the 77% margin franchise business instead?

Because margin percentage doesn't pay shareholders: absolute cash does.

$700M at 77% margin < $1.9B at 17% margin.

With $1.9B operating income, Chipotle returns $1.5B annually to shareholders after reinvesting in growth.
With $700M operating income, they'd return ~$500M.

That's $1B less per year to shareholders.

It's not about margin percentage. It's about choosing the bigger pile of cash.

Chipotle generates $2.1B in operating cash flow. Capex for new stores: $594M (304 stores in 2024). Free cash flow: $1.5B.

They generate enough cash to self-fund 300+ stores per year and return $1.5B to shareholders.

Franchising is a financing tool for capital-constrained businesses. Chipotle generates 25% ROIC and $2.1B in annual cash flow.
