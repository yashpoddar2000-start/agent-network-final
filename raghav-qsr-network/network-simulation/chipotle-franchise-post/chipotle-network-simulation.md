**Role:** Universal research agent with institutional QSR expertise
**Mindset:** "I read every 10-Q, know unit economics by heart, worked on restaurant turnarounds"

**Agent Decision:** "Let me survey the QSR landscape for interesting contrarian patterns or unusual business models."

### **Tool Call 1: exaAnswerTool**
```
Queries:
1. "What percentage of McDonald's restaurants are franchised?"
2. "What percentage of Subway restaurants are franchised?" 
3. "What percentage of Burger King restaurants are franchised?"
4. "What percentage of KFC restaurants are franchised?"
5. "What percentage of Chipotle restaurants are franchised?"

9. "What are the largest QSR chains by revenue in 2024?"
10. "What are the most profitable QSR chains per store?"
```

### **Mock Exa Response:**
```
Results:
1. McDonald's: 95% franchised
2. Subway: 100% franchised  
3. Burger King: 100% franchised
4. KFC: 98% franchised
5. Chipotle: 0% franchised ⚡️
6. Starbucks: 40% franchised
7. Domino's: 98% franchised
8. Typical royalty rate: 6-8%
9. Top chains: McDonald's ($23.2B), Starbucks ($35.9B), Subway ($10.2B), Chipotle ($9.9B)

**"ANOMALY DETECTED: Chipotle 0% franchised vs industry standard 95-100%. This is a massive outlier among top chains. Given Chipotle's high profitability ($3.2M/store) and scale ($9.9B revenue), this contrarian strategy warrants deep investigation. This could be viral-worthy."**

**Decision:** "Continue with Chipotle deep-dive. This anomaly has institutional-grade insight potential."

## 🔍 LEVEL 2: CHIPOTLE FINANCIAL FORENSICS

### **Mock Exa Response:**
```
Results:

12. Store profit: $862K/year  
13. Store investment: $1.0M
14. Restaurant-level margin: 26.7%
15. ROIC: 25%
16. Payback: 3 years
17. 2024 restaurants: 3,500
18. 2024 operating income: $1.9B
19. 2015 restaurants: 2,010

```

### **Agent Analysis:**
**"Exceptional unit economics: 25% ROIC, 3-year payback, $862K profit per store. Operating income grew 2.5x in 9 years ($764M → $1.9B). These are PE-grade returns on company-owned assets. The 0% franchise strategy appears to be driving superior financial performance vs. typical franchise models."**

**Agent Decision:** "The financial data is compelling. Now I need to quantify exactly what Chipotle is giving up by not franchising. This requires mathematical modeling."**

## 🧮 LEVEL 3: MATHEMATICAL MODELING & SCENARIO ANALYSIS

### **Agent:** Restaurant Financial Modeler 
**Role:** Universal analysis agent with PE/investment banking expertise
**Mindset:** "I model restaurant acquisitions, understand franchise economics, build DCF models"

**Agent Decision:** "With 3,500 stores generating $862K profit each, what would the franchise alternative look like? I need to calculate the opportunity cost of Chipotle's 0% franchise strategy."

### **Mathematical Analysis Process:**

#### **Current Model Calculation:**
```
Store-level profit: 3,500 stores × $862K = $3.0B
Less corporate overhead: $3.0B - $697M = $1.9B operating income
Operating margin: $1.9B ÷ $11.3B = 17%
```

#### **Franchise Model Scenario:**
```
Franchise revenue: 3,500 stores × $3.2M × 8% royalty = $904M
Less franchise overhead: $904M - $200M (estimated) = $700M operating income  
Operating margin: $700M ÷ $904M = 77%
```

#### **The Gap Calculation:**
```
Current operating income: $1.9B
Franchise operating income: $700M
Annual difference: $1.9B - $700M = $1.2B lost per year ⚡️
```

### **Agent Analysis:**
**"BREAKTHROUGH INSIGHT: Chipotle's decision to remain 0% franchised is worth $1.2B annually. While franchising would deliver 77% margins vs 17%, the absolute dollars are dramatically lower ($700M vs $1.9B). This is a classic margin percentage vs absolute cash trade-off that most investors miss."**

**Agent Decision:** "This $1.2B quantification is viral-worthy, but I need to understand WHY Chipotle makes this choice. The strategic reasoning will make this institutional-grade analysis."**

---

## 🎯 LEVEL 4: STRATEGIC CONTEXT INVESTIGATION  

### **Agent:** PE Restaurant Advisory Partner
**Role:** Universal context agent with strategic consulting expertise  
**Mindset:** "I advise PE firms on fast-casual acquisitions, understand operational levers, worked at McKinsey"

**Agent Decision:** "The $1.2B insight is powerful, but institutional investors need to understand the strategic rationale. Why does Chipotle sacrifice franchise margins for company ownership?"

### **Tool Call 3: deepResearchPromptAgent + exaDeepResearchTool**

**Deep Research Prompt:**
> "Analyze Chipotle's strategic decision to maintain 0% franchised restaurants when competitors like McDonald's (95% franchised) and Subway (100% franchised) use franchise models. Investigate the operational control mechanisms, supply chain advantages, execution requirements, and financial reasoning behind this contrarian approach. Focus on management's stated rationale from 10-K filings, operational complexity requirements, and competitive advantages that franchising would compromise. Examine the trade-offs between capital efficiency and operational control in the fast-casual segment."

### **Mock Deep Research Response:**
```
Strategic Analysis: Chipotle's Anti-Franchise Strategy

MANAGEMENT RATIONALE:
- CEO statements emphasize "execution consistency" as non-negotiable
- 10-K filings state franchising would "compromise operational excellence"
- Board believes franchise model incompatible with "Food with Integrity" standards

OPERATIONAL CONTROL REQUIREMENTS:
- Uniform training protocols across all locations
- Choreographed crew movements for throughput optimization  
- Integrated digital ordering systems (35% of sales)
- Same-day fresh ingredient delivery (no freezers, no microwaves)

SUPPLY CHAIN ADVANTAGES:
- Direct relationships with 100+ suppliers (no third-party distributors)
- Volume purchasing power across 3,500 locations
- Quality standards: DNA testing, no antibiotics, no hormones
- Food costs: 29.8% vs competitor average 32-35%
- Annual savings: $226M+ from supply chain control

COMPETITIVE MOAT:
- "Franchising fragments purchasing. Volume discounts disappear."
- Execution discipline maintains 25% ROIC across system
- "Without execution consistency, ROIC collapses"

CAPITAL PHILOSOPHY:
- "Franchising is a financing tool for capital-constrained businesses"  
- Chipotle generates $2.1B operating cash flow
- Self-funds 300+ stores annually ($594M capex)
- "Margin percentage doesn't pay shareholders: absolute cash does"
```

### **Agent Analysis:**
**"The strategic context is compelling: Chipotle trades franchise capital efficiency for operational control that drives superior unit economics. The 2-3% food cost advantage alone saves $226M annually. Management views franchising as dilutive to execution standards that generate 25% ROIC. This is sophisticated capital allocation."**

**Agent Decision:** "I have viral insight with institutional depth: $1.2B quantified impact + strategic reasoning. Ready for quality evaluation."**
