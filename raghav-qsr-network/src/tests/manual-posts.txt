"If you raise the effing hot dog, I will kill you. Figure it out."

Costco founder Jim Sinegal to his CEO, 2013.

$1.50 in 1984. $1.50 in 2024. Through 191.89% inflation.

The hot dog costs $4.55 to make. They sell it for $1.50. Loss: $3.00 per unit.

200 million sold annually. Total loss: $600 million.

Costco FY2024 operating income: $7.4 billion. Membership fees: $4.8 billion.

Membership fees = 65% of their operating profit.

Merchandise? Sold at 10.9% gross margin. That barely covers overhead after rent, labor, utilities.

Costco doesn't make money selling you stuff. The profit is in the $65-130 membership fee.

This changes how you think about the hot dog.

The real trade-off:

The "$600M loss" includes every cost: factory, workers, electricity, rent.

But Costco is paying for those things anyway. The factory makes other food. The workers are already there.

The only new cost per hot dog? Ingredients. About $2.50.

So raising the price isn't "stop losing $600M." It's "make an extra $0.49 per hot dog on ingredient costs."

Raise to $1.99: $0.49 more × 200M units = $98M additional revenue.

Sounds good. Until you run the member math.

If just 0.5% of members don't renew because "Costco changed":

137 million members × 0.5% = 685,000 people.

Each member's lifetime value (fees + spending over 10 years): $750.

685,000 × $750 = $514 million lost.

$98M in hot dog revenue vs $514M in lifetime value.

Even at 0.5% churn, the price increase destroys value. And the actual sensitivity is probably higher: the hot dog is Costco's most visible commitment to never changing.

This is why 2008 mattered:

Hebrew National, their supplier, raised prices. Threatened the $1.50.

Costco's choice: raise the price or build their own factory.

They built a factory. Not to "save money": to control the one variable protecting their entire value proposition. Strategic necessity, not efficiency.

The hot dog isn't a customer acquisition tool. It's an internal constraint.

Costco's model only works at brutally low margins (10.9% vs Walmart's 24%). If margins expand, members question the membership fee. Value perception breaks.

The hot dog is the enforcement mechanism. It sets the ceiling for the entire business.

Why won't In-N-Out expand to the East Coast?

Fresh ingredients. Daily deliveries. No freezers.

Distribution centers in California, Texas, Arizona, Colorado. 300-600 mile radius.

Beyond that, the model breaks.

But the real competitive advantage isn't freshness. It's labor economics.

In-N-Out's labor costs: 33% of revenue.
McDonald's: 23%.

In-N-Out pays $20-22/hour starting wage. McDonald's pays $15/hour.

In-N-Out: 20% EBITDA margin.
McDonald's: 10% profit margin.

Higher labor costs, better margins.

Why:

McDonald's: 100% turnover. Replaces 20-30 employees annually at $1,700-$4,100 each. $78,500 annual churn cost per store.

In-N-Out: 91% recommend the job. They stay.

Pay more. Keep employees. Make double the profit.

But it only works with regional clustering.

100% of In-N-Out managers promoted from within.

Regional clustering enables:
• In-N-Out University trains employees centrally
• Managers transfer between stores without relocating
• Career path from cashier to manager is visible
• Lower turnover saves $100K+ per store annually
• Those savings fund higher wages

424 stores, company-owned.

McDonald's: 13,000+ franchised locations.

In-N-Out University doesn't scale to 13,000 franchises. Manager transfers don't work 1,000 miles apart.

In-N-Out: $5.8M revenue, $1.16M profit per store.
McDonald's: $4.0M revenue, $400K profit per store.

3x the profit per location.

424 stores × $1.16M = $492M profit.
13,000 stores × $400K = $5.2B profit.

In-N-Out's supply chain limits expansion. But that limitation created something McDonald's can't replicate: regional density that turns labor costs into competitive advantage.

POST 3:
Egg prices tripled in 2024. McDonald's and Wendy's both lost 8.7% of breakfast traffic, but their sales moved in opposite directions:

McDonald's: Q2 2024 breakfast same-store sales flat. Held prices with $1 Egg McMuffin promos.
Wendy's: Q2 2024 breakfast same-store sales +6%. Raised prices 4%, introduced $3 combo.

Why opposite strategies?

McDonald's: 30% of total revenue from breakfast.
Wendy's: 7.5% of total revenue from breakfast.

When breakfast is 30% of revenue, you can't afford to bleed traffic. Absorb costs. Hold price. Keep customers.

When breakfast is 7.5% of revenue, you can raise prices and accept traffic loss. The math says let some customers walk.

This isn't about "pricing power." It's about how much of your business you can afford to risk.

McDonald's franchisees absorbed the cost and took the margin hit. Corporate ran $1 promos. Franchisee group said it's "not sustainable without financial support."

Wendy's raised prices 4%. Traffic dropped 8.7%, sales grew 6%. Revenue per transaction up 15%.

The strategy isn't about brand strength. It's about what percentage of your revenue you can afford to lose.

But here's the real story:

Convenience store breakfast traffic: +9% in same period.
Fast food breakfast traffic: +1%.

48% of convenience store breakfast customers replaced a fast food visit.
75% cited "value" as the reason.

The egg shock didn't just test pricing power. It revealed who was actually competing with whom.

Wendy's thought they were competing with McDonald's for breakfast customers.

They were actually competing with convenience stores.

Convenience stores don't have the same problem. Breakfast is a traffic driver for higher-margin items (coffee, energy drinks, snacks). They can price breakfast at cost to pull customers in, then capture margin on the rest of the basket.

Fast food chains need breakfast to be profitable on its own. Convenience stores just need it to get people in the door.

McDonald's held prices. Lost 8.7% of traffic anyway.
Wendy's raised prices. Lost 8.7% of traffic anyway.
Convenience stores gained 9% of traffic.

When commodity costs spike, your strategy depends on daypart exposure.

High exposure (30% of revenue): Absorb costs, hold price, protect traffic.
Low exposure (7.5% of revenue): Raise prices, accept traffic loss, optimize margin.

But neither strategy works if your competitor doesn't need breakfast to be profitable.

Fast food chains fought over pricing strategy while convenience stores changed the game entirely.
